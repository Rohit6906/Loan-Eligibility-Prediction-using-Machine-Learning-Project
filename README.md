# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Project
A project where machine learning models predict whether a person is eligible for loan or not.
1) Multiple Machine Learing models are used to train and test the data.Used hyperparameter tuing to boost the results.
2) Compared the models based on accuracy, f1 score, precision and recall.
3) Selected the model that performs the best.
